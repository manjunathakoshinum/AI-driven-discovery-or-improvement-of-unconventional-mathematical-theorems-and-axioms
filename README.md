# AI-Driven Discovery or Improvement of Unconventional Mathematical Theorems and Axioms  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on leveraging **Artificial Intelligence, Neuro-Symbolic AI, Reinforcement Learning, and Theorem Proving** to discover, refine, and enhance unconventional mathematical theorems and axioms, specifically in **Hyperbolic Geometry & Non-Euclidean Mathematics**.  

Our goal is to develop a **powerful AI-driven framework** capable of:  
✅ Extracting, validating, and improving mathematical theorems  
✅ Discovering new postulates and axioms  
✅ Utilizing **graph-based AI**, **theorem provers (Lean, Coq, MetaMath)**, and **evolutionary search**  
✅ Enabling high-impact research in unconventional mathematics
